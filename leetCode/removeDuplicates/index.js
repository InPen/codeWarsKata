// Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

// Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

// Clarification:

// Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

// Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

// Internally you can think of this:

const removeDuplicates = nums =>{
    let uniqueNums = [...new Set(nums)]
    console.log(uniqueNums);
}
nums([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4])
