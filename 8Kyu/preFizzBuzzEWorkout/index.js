// This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.
// Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.
// Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive)
// Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.

const preFizz = n => {
    const nArr = []
    n = 1

    while(nArr.length < n){
        nArr.push(num)
        num += 1
    }

    console.log(nArr);
}
